# Tower of Hanoi

This repository contains an implementation of the Tower of Hanoi puzzle. The Tower of Hanoi is a classic mathematical problem involving three pegs and a number of disks of different sizes. The objective is to move all the disks from the source peg to the destination peg using an auxiliary peg, adhering to the following rules:

1. Only one disk can be moved at a time.
2. A disk can only be placed on top of a larger disk or on an empty peg.
3. All disks start on the source peg in decreasing size, with the largest disk at the bottom.

## Features

- Recursive and iterative solutions
- Visualization of the moves
- Customizable number of disks
- Step-by-step move instructions

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites



### Installation

1. *Clone the repository:*
   sh
   git clone https://github.com/anshu-2005/tower-of-hanoi.git
   cd tower-of-hanoi
   

## Usage

### Running the Python Script

To run the Tower of Hanoi program:

sh
python tower_of_hanoi.py


You can adjust the number of disks by modifying the variable in the script.

### Example Output

When you run the script, you will see the sequence of moves required to solve the Tower of Hanoi puzzle. For example, with 3 disks:


Move disk 1 from A to C
Move disk 2 from A to B
Move disk 1 from C to B
Move disk 3 from A to C
Move disk 1 from B to A
Move disk 2 from B to C
Move disk 1 from A to C


### Visualizing the Moves

If you have a visualization component, provide instructions on how to use it here. For example, if you have an HTML file:

1. Open index.html in your web browser.
2. Enter the number of disks and watch the steps of the solution.
